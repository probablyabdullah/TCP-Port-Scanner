# TCP-Port-Scanner
**A no-frills TCP Port Scanner using Python**
A TCP port scanner is a tool used to scan a target system for open TCP ports. It works by sending packets to the target system's IP address and port numbers and analyzing the responses to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
TCP port scanning is a commonly used technique in network reconnaissance and security testing. By identifying which ports are open, an attacker can gain insight into the services running on the target system, and potentially exploit any vulnerabilities associated with those services.
There are various types of TCP port scanners, including simple scanners that scan a single port, advanced scanners that can scan multiple ports simultaneously, and stealth scanners that attempt to evade detection by firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
While TCP port scanning can be a valuable tool for security professionals and system administrators, it can also be used for malicious purposes. As a result, it's important to use TCP port scanners responsibly and only with explicit permission from the target system's owner.
