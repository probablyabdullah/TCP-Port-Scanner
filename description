Here you will find a complete explanation of how the code works:

1. The code imports necessary modules:
   - `socket`: Provides low-level networking interface for creating sockets.
   - `threading`: Allows for concurrent execution of multiple threads.

2. It prompts the user to enter their IP address and the range of ports to scan.

3. It initializes some variables, including an empty `main_array` to store the open ports.

4. It sets the default timeout for socket operations to 0.001 seconds.

5. It defines a function `conn` that takes an IP address, port number, and a lock object as arguments. This function attempts to establish a TCP connection with the specified IP and port using a socket. If the connection is successful (result code 0), it adds the port to the `main_array`. The lock is used to ensure thread-safe access to the shared `main_array` list.

6. The code enters a loop that iterates through the range of ports specified by the user. For each port, it creates a new thread that calls the `conn` function with the IP address, port number, and lock.

7. The created threads are started, and references to them are stored in the `thread_array`.

8. The code waits for all threads to complete using the `join()` method, ensuring that all port scan threads have finished.

9. After the threads have finished, the code prints a separator line and displays the list of open ports stored in the `main_array`.

10. Finally, it prints another separator line for visual separation.

The code performs a simple TCP port scan, attempting to establish a connection with each port in the specified range. If a connection is successful, the port number is added to the `main_array`, which is then displayed as the result of the scan.
